# üöÄ PythonAnywhere Redeploy Action

This GitHub Action automates the redeployment of a Django application hosted on **PythonAnywhere** via SSH.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: SSH access on PythonAnywhere is **only available for paid accounts**. This action will not work with free accounts.


## üì¶ What does this action do?

- Connects to PythonAnywhere via SSH  
- Pulls the latest code from the `main` branch  
- Installs Python dependencies with `pip`  
- Runs `collectstatic` and `migrate`  
- Restarts the web server by touching the `WSGI` file


## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### Workflow example

```yaml
name: Deploy to PythonAnywhere

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Redeploy to PythonAnywhere
        uses: MiguelRizzi/pythonanywhere-deploy-ssh@v1.0
        with:
          username: ${{ secrets.PA_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.PA_PASSWORD }}
          working_directory: ${{ secrets.PA_WORKING_DIRECTORY }}
          venv_directory: ${{ secrets.PA_VENV_DIRECTORY }}
          wsgi_file: /var/www/webapp_name_wsgi.py
```

## Inputs

| Name      | Description | Required | Example |
|-----------|-------------|----------|---------|
| username  | Your PythonAnywhere username | ‚úÖ | miguelrizzi |
| password  | Your PythonAnywhere password | ‚úÖ | password |
| working_directory  | Target working directory on PythonAnywhere | ‚úÖ | /home/username/webapp_name |
| venv_directory  | Path to the Python virtual environment | ‚úÖ | /home/username/webapp_name/.venv |
| wsgi_file | Path to the WSGI file to reload the app | ‚úÖ | /var/www/webapp_name_wsgi.py |


## üîê Security

- **Always** use secrets for:
  - `username`
  - `password`
  - any sensitive tokens or credentials

These values can expose your account if leaked, even in public forks or workflow logs.

- For paths such as `working_directory`, `venv_directory`, and `wsgi_file`:
  - Using secrets is **optional**.
  - You can define them directly in the YAML file if they do not contain sensitive data and remain consistent across environments.
  - **Using secrets is recommended if:**
    - They include your username
    - You want to keep the configuration more private or flexible


## üìÅ Repository Structure

This action is composed of:

- `action.yml`  
Defines the input interface of the GitHub Action (required inputs) and specifies the execution environment. In this case, it sets up execution in a Docker container that runs the `deploy.sh` script.

- `deploy.sh`  
Main script executed inside the container. It uses `sshpass` to connect to PythonAnywhere via SSH, performs `git pull`, installs dependencies, runs migrations, and restarts the web server by touching the `WSGI.py` file.

- `Dockerfile`  
Defines a custom Docker image based on `ubuntu`, installs `sshpass`, and copies the required scripts. This ensures the environment has all necessary tools to perform the redeploy process without relying on the host runner.
